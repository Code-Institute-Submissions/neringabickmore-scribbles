# Scribble #

[Scribble]() is an interactive book review app where site users create, read, update and delete their own content.

About three years ago I have made a conscious decision to read more books. I have read quite a lot of them since but could never keep the track of them. I am also always interested in recommendations from other like-minded readers. When it come to creating my third milestone project at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), it had to be a book review app where I can share my reviews with site visitors and other users.

### User Requirements and Expectations ###

#### **Requirements** ####

- Visually pleasant app design
- Easy site navigation
- Information of the content layed out in a simple and clear way on both mobile and larger screens
- Self-explanatory icons where text is absent

#### **Expectations** ####

- User information is protected by the site
- User is able to manipulate elements of the particular page
- Quick app load time
- Users are able to find and contact admin when required (i.e. account deletion)

### Design Choices ###

The aim of the site design is to ensure the focus is on the book reviews. I have chosen neutral color palette and will adopt minimalistic site features throughout. Icons used on the site are easy to understand and read and therefore text use is avoided where possible.

#### **Fonts** ####

#### **Colours** ####

I chose the colours that I felt are quite delicate and not overpowering the main content of the app.

![Colour palette](/wireframes/colour_palette/color_palette.jpg)

#### **Wireframes** ####

Firstly, I have created a site [map](/wireframes/flowcharts/sitemap.png) to identify clear features the site will have when viewed by the visitor, user and admin. 

I designed my site moc-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). I was focusing on defining the basic layout structure of the app and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile and larger screens](/wireframes/site_wireframes/about.visitor.png).


To make user account creation logic easier to understand and simplify the management of it, I have created [workflow-chart](/wireframes/flowcharts/account_creation.jpg).

## Features ##

### Features Implemented ###

- **Responsive design**

The game has different layout options, focused on *mobile-first* design in mind as more users are expected to use mobile or tablet devices than desktop.

## Credits ##

### Audio ###

### Images ###

You can find the images of the coins used for the site [here](/assets/images). I have sourced them through various websites, which are free to use:

- []()

### Colour ###

I have identified the colour palette on []()

### Image editing ###

- I have used the snippet tool for capturing screengrabs which I saved as images.
- MS Paint 3D to give the same background colour for the coin images as the button.
- A handy [Birme](https://www.birme.net/?target_width=300&target_height=300&quality=100&border_width=1&border_color=%23bd3d3a) site allowed me to resize the images all at once.
